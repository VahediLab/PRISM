Description: Calculates cell-to-cell variation in chromatin accessibility at a set of DNA sequences (unified by some common characteristic, like TF binding). Uses angular cosine distance inputted into principal coordinate analysis. Then calculates each cell's distance frmo the centroid in full principal coordinate space.
